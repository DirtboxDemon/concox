1. Case 22, should have a packet length of 43 * 2, but we're receiving otherwise
	e.g. 78782222190109022901c30166d5d00855d6500014f501945679e300a691000e00027a0b5d0d0a

2. Case 22, we're receiving 2025 date very frequently

3. Case 22, in documentation it is written to convert the date string to decimal, but not working.

4. How can we filter out invalid packets, by starting 7878/7979 and end 0d0a, if multiple packets are coming clubbed together.
